# Running the HTML Code Locally

This README provides instructions on how to view and run your HTML file on a local machine. The process is straightforward and does not require any special software beyond a web browser.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a modern web browser installed on your computer such as:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (for macOS users)

## Steps to Run the HTML File

1. **Download the HTML Project**: 
    - If the project files are on GitHub, clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    - If you received the files directly, ensure they are extracted from any archive (like a ZIP file) and placed in a folder on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**: 
    - Open the folder where you saved or extracted your project files.

3. **Open the HTML File**:
    - Locate the HTML file you wish to run. This file will typically have a `.html` extension, such as `index.html`.
    - Double-click the HTML file. It should open in your default web browser.
    - Alternatively, you can open your browser first, and then use the `File > Open File...` menu (the exact wording may vary) to navigate to and open the HTML file.

4. **Interact with the Page**: 
    - Once the HTML file is open in the browser, you can interact with it as you would with any web page.
    - The HTML file references other files such as CSS or JavaScript, make sure these files are also located within the project folder and properly linked within the HTML file.
